# Firebase Access Issue - No Project Resources

## Current Issue
You can't see "Project resources" in Firebase Console, which means you don't have owner access to the existing project.

## Option 1: Get Added as Owner (Recommended)

### Step 1: Contact Current Owner
Ask the current owner of `courseconnect-61eme` to:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Select project `courseconnect-61eme`
3. Go to **Project Settings** → **Users and permissions**
4. Add `courseconnect.noreply@gmail.com` as **Owner**

### Step 2: Once You Have Access
1. Go to Firebase Console with `courseconnect.noreply@gmail.com`
2. Select project `courseconnect-61eme`
3. Go to **Project Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll down to **Project resources**
5. Click **Change** next to "Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location"
6. Select your new Google Cloud project

## Option 2: Create New Firebase Project

### Step 1: Create New Firebase Project
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Sign in with `courseconnect.noreply@gmail.com`
3. Click "Add project"
4. Enter project name: `courseconnect-new`
5. Choose your new Google Cloud project
6. Enable Google Analytics (optional)
7. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Get New Firebase Configuration
1. In Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** (gear icon)
2. Scroll down to "Your apps"
3. Click "Add app" → Web app (</> icon)
4. Register app name: "CourseConnect AI Web"
5. Copy the Firebase configuration

### Step 3: Update Code with New Config
Replace the Firebase config in `src/lib/firebase/client-simple.ts`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  "projectId": "courseconnect-new", // or whatever you name it
  "appId": "your-new-app-id",
  "storageBucket": "courseconnect-new.firebasestorage.app",
  "apiKey": "your-new-api-key",
  "authDomain": "courseconnect-new.firebaseapp.com",
  "messagingSenderId": "your-new-sender-id",
  "databaseURL": "https://courseconnect-new-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
};
```

### Step 4: Configure Authentication
1. Go to **Authentication** → **Sign-in method**
2. Enable **Google** provider
3. Add your OAuth client ID and secret
4. Add authorized domains: `www.courseconnectai.com`

## Option 3: Check Current Access Level

### Step 1: Verify What You Can See
In Firebase Console with `courseconnect.noreply@gmail.com`:
1. Can you see the project `courseconnect-61eme` in the project list?
2. If yes, what options do you see in Project Settings?
3. If no, you need to be added as a member first

### Step 2: Check Project Settings
If you can access the project, go to **Project Settings** and check:
- **General** tab - what sections do you see?
- **Users and permissions** - are you listed? What role?
- **Billing** - can you see this section?

## Current Firebase Configuration

Your current config in `src/lib/firebase/client-simple.ts`:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  "projectId": "courseconnect-61eme",
  "appId": "1:150901346125:web:116c79e5f3521488e97104",
  "storageBucket": "courseconnect-61eme.firebasestorage.app",
  "apiKey": "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
  "authDomain": "courseconnect-61eme.firebaseapp.com",
  "messagingSenderId": "150901346125",
  "databaseURL": "https://courseconnect-61eme-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com"
};
```

## What You Need to Decide

1. **Do you have access to the existing project?** (Can you see it in Firebase Console?)
2. **Do you want to keep existing data?** (Users, chats, etc.)
3. **Are you the original creator?** (Do you have the original email that created it?)

## Quick Test

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Sign in with `courseconnect.noreply@gmail.com`
3. Tell me what projects you can see in the list

## Next Steps

Based on your answers:
- **If you can see the project**: We'll work on getting owner access
- **If you can't see the project**: We'll create a new project
- **If you want to keep data**: We'll need to migrate from old to new project

## Support

Please share:
1. What projects you can see in Firebase Console
2. Whether you want to keep existing data
3. If you have access to the original email that created the project
