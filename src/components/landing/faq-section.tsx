    question: "What file types can I upload?",
    answer: "We support <strong>PDF, DOCX, and TXT</strong> files. You can upload your syllabus, lecture notes, reading summaries, or assignment prompts. The AI reads them all to build context for your course. <br/><br/><span class='text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 italic'>(Lecture notes and handwritten text support is coming soon!)</span>"
  },
  {
    question: "Does the AI actually know my specific course?",
    answer: "Yes. When you create a \"Course Chat,\" the AI references the syllabus and files you uploaded for that class. It can answer questions based on your actual course materials, deadlines, and assignments. We're continuously improving the AI's ability to extract and remember course-specific details like professor names and topics."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the deadline extraction?",
    answer: "Our AI extraction is highly accurate for standard syllabus formats. It identifies exam dates, assignment deadlines, reading schedules, and grading policies. If it misses something, you can view all extracted deadlines in your dashboard. Manual editing features are coming soon."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it really free?",
    answer: "Yes. We are currently in public beta, so <strong>all features are free</strong>. You can upload unlimited files and send unlimited messages. We don't even ask for a credit card to sign up."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I edit the deadlines if the AI misses something?",
    answer: "The AI tries to extract all deadlines automatically, but it's not perfect yet. Right now, you can view the extracted deadlines in your dashboard. We are currently building the feature to let you manually add, edit, or delete deadlines if the syllabus parser misses one."
