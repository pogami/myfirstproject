Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. This document covers the essential concepts and applications.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn patterns
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment

Applications:
- Image recognition and computer vision
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics
- Autonomous vehicles

The field continues to evolve rapidly with new algorithms and techniques being developed regularly.
